<p><hr><br>Now this sounds harsh but it is most likely true at some level, but a mixed comfort is that you are not alone in this. The industry itself - the sharp dressed guys and girls with great powerpoints and demos and those very confident smiles whom you trust giving you the right technology advice - rarely knows themselves what they are really talking about. </p>
<p>Now this is not a surprise for the grizzled life-tired CTOs around who has stood as despairingly witnesses to this two times to many, but it is always certainly something to have in the back of your mind of before investing deep on someone elses advice.</p>
<p>Let me rewind a bit and give you a brief summary of the state of the it-industry. A common analogy to software development in general - and certainly enterprise software suites - is house construction. There are many more analogies, and they all have the same flaws in common. So - you may want a small town house for your lovely family or a large scyscraper filled with apartments and awe-inspiring offices and a casino for when the employees clocks out (and the challenges <em>are</em> different for a town house and a scyscraper), but the bottom line is that you don’t know how to build a townhouse, never mind a scyscraper, so you find someone who does. </p>
<p>Now - you get the best contractor you can find and have meetings. There you opt in for a pre-built modules solutions for most of the building to save time and money, or you may want more charm and character to the whole thing and hire carpenters to custom build everything to your own desires. It costs more, but then you get exactly what you’ve had in mind. Now the project starts, it always starts of good, then <em>situations</em> arises that you have to deal with, which may make the whole ordeal more expensive (but very rarely cheaper), and then at the end you have your building. The budget may have been met, or it may have been exceeded by quite a lot depending on the sum of situations encountered.</p>
<p>And there you go. Analogy holds up and everything, and lets treat tech projects as building projects and we’re fine. Right?</p>
<p>But it’s not right. Not by a long mile. The big difference of comparing building constructions and building software suites is the thousands and thousands of years of experience we have of building constructions. Now - we don’t think much of it, we only know that we probably won’t be able to build this house by ourselves - large or small - at least not according to rules and regulations. The amount of knowledge of construction building compared to software building is <em>absolutely staggering</em>. </p>
<p>House building is ingrained in all of us, and we don’t give at a second thought. This is also why you never are offered the choice of opting out of a roof on your building, or why your suggestions of using duct tape instead of screws is politely but absolutely ignored. The contractor <em>knows without thought</em> that the bloody thing will flood and rot and topple over if he ever gave in to the request. At the same time, most of us knows without thought that it would be a silly thing to ask for, so we never would have asked in the first place.</p>
<p>The IT-industry knows none of this. Mankind has been building houses for more than ten millenia. IT industry is what - 60 years old? And that’s pushing “IT industry” to its furthest. We don’t have many <strong>truths</strong>. Oh - we have <em>opinons</em>. That we really have a lot of. And some of those opinions may sometime in the future be known as <em>truths</em>, allthough it will take a whole lot of toppled buildings before we get there. </p>
<p>We have opinons and our sellers (there are always sellers) have a pick at the opinions available and take the one most likely to sell. And the sellers take those opinions, make them more appetizing and bring them to you. The sellers <em>believe</em> in these opinons - don’t get me wrong - but their actual knowledge is shallow, and determining whether or not they really apply to your needs is most likely beyond their capacity. </p>
<p>The problem with really all analogies regarding IT and software is that they are analogies to something we are very competent at. But we are not competent at IT. Not yet. Oh yes, there are some <em>extremely</em> competent individuals and teams and companies, but as a whole industry - this is all still pretty new to us. We are still making the road by walking the road.</p>

Knowledge and experience is the easiest answer, but also the hardest and most painful to achieve. </p>
<p>Knowledge in the sense of knowing the options, and how to sift the good from the terrible. This post does not provide the answers, but it certainly has a few <em>opinions</em> on what to be aware of.</p>
<h4 id="Business-processes-bottlenecks-and-low-hanging-fruits"><a href="#Business-processes-bottlenecks-and-low-hanging-fruits" class="headerlink" title="Business processes, bottlenecks and low hanging fruits"></a>Business processes, bottlenecks and low hanging fruits</h4><p>If you want to have an efficient IT-strategy you need efficient business. A medium or large business may have lost track of how business is actually conducted a long time ago. There may be parts of it that are terribly ineffecient, other teams keep seperate track of the same data, essentially doing the same job twice or triple for no added value. There may be teams working in frustrating and impracticable conditions. It is crucial to map out where the <strong>business bottlenecks</strong> are, where work is been done twice over and where people are generally unhappy. I think the last one is the most important one. Happy employees with tools and facilities that enables their productivity are invaluable. Making the job of mapping your business processes will help you optimize areas of redundancy as well as setting your priorities. Whatever action that makes the most positive impact on your business for the least amount of effort should be first in line. </p>
<h4 id="Solutions-that-solves-it-all"><a href="#Solutions-that-solves-it-all" class="headerlink" title="Solutions that solves-it-all"></a>Solutions that solves-it-all</h4><p>When you hit a certain size, you will be in the target zone of <em>big</em> products. ERPs promise to take of all your business needs and more in a single (portfolio) of systems, ESBs with the power of turning your legacy spaghetti to a beautiful uniform lasagne. These solutions may solve many of your challenges but be aware that you will probably never get rid of a big product once it’s introduced to the business. </p>
<p>It will sit as a massive lump in the core of your enterprise, and will probably be the biggest bottleneck to any change you want to do later on. </p>
<p> There is also the problem with the sole idea of one thing that solves everything. Now - a secret of the industry. <em>You can use absolutely any piece of tech to perform any given task - big or small</em>. You really can, and it will even sort of work. But that doesn’t mean it will work <em>good</em>, and that people will be happy about it.<!-- TODO great analogy --></p>
<p>Another issue with big products is the share risk and cost involved. Not only for the obvious reasons, but for lack of track record authenticity. </p>
<p>Every introduction of a big product in any business, unless it has failed beyond denial, will be reported as an absolute success. Every time, even though the cost tripled at the end and everything is now aweful and none of the users like it, the loss of prestige in admitting that it probably wasn’t a good idea after all is more than most are willing to bear. </p>
<p>So what you get is a small number of failures and a whole lot of success-stories. But you don’t get the very interesting grey area in between where your business probably would be. </p>
<h4 id="Revolutionise-your-IT"><a href="#Revolutionise-your-IT" class="headerlink" title="Revolutionise your IT"></a>Revolutionise your IT</h4><p>An IT-revolution of your business sounds very bold and forward-leaning, but it takes a lot of effort. And effort translates into time. </p>
<p>That again means that you will have to live with and support your old systems for months or years before you can shift over to your new platform. Meanwhile your needs may very well change. But let’s assume best scenario and say that they don’t change very much from your original needs.</p>
<p>A complete rewrite or absorption of your current portfolio of systems will take the estimated time to <em>finish as per contract</em>, but will take a hell of a lot longer time to be feature complete and bug free. And that is not strange at all. </p>
<p>There is no system on earth documented enough to contain all the little sub features and weird bug fixes that matters so much to the users. That again makes it impossible to specify and estimate in advance how long it will take to absorb or rewrite that system. When you multiply this with your entire portfolio of systems you suddenly find yourself in a big mess.</p>
<p>Never do an IT revolution - do an evolution. Pick the low hanging fruits - the most bang for the buck, do a honest-to-god <em>lessons learned</em> when completing and change your direction and strategy as you go along. It doesn’t mean you should throw your strategic goals overboard every six months, only adjust and change how you go about reaching them.</p>
<h4 id="Solutions-that-make-sense"><a href="#Solutions-that-make-sense" class="headerlink" title="Solutions that make sense"></a>Solutions that make sense</h4><p>Now this is a bit of delicate ground to thread, so I’ll choose my words carefully. <em>Solutions that makes sense to <em>you</em> isn’t neccesarily a sensible solution</em>.</p>
<p>Many years ago I had the pleasure of being a hapless witness to a new kind of IT-solution being introduced to a whole range of big customers. It was the most intuitive system ever build - and it’s core concept was so easy that everyone <em>got it</em>. It basically was an implementation of how humans - you and I - conceptualize and associate the world. </p>
<p>It was like a human mind with the power of a computers behind it - and one mind could connect with other minds to combine all the wisdom and knowledge, with no worries about schemas or formats or all that technical nonsense and creating associations and new knowledge that no one had thought of before. </p>
<p>Now - to those of you who has interest in the more recent data science trend, this might seem a bit of the same, right? Combining all of yours and others data into new knowledge? The solutions that make that possible today <em>does not make sense</em> to a non-tech, or is at the very least very very complicated. Just try to look past the <em>lakes</em> and the <em>hives</em> and the other words and try to get a straight answer on how it actually works. You’ll be amazed of the number of diciplines involved in creating new knowledge from your data.</p>
<p>Any way - back to the digital brain. <em>It sold like warm bread</em>.</p>
<p>Advisors could go directly to top management, show them a dazzling powerpoint and see the light in their eyes turn on. It was <em>mindbendingly</em> obvious what this solutions did, how it worked and how it could empower them. Much in contrast to all the other solutions that they barely grasped at all. People like what they understand and mistrust anything they don’t and that’s how we are. They liked it so much that they started telling everyone that would listen about this new wonder.</p>
<p>As you may have guessed - having probably never heard of the miracle at hand - it crashed and burned. Or, actually - that is not what happened.</p>
<p>The concept might have been academically sound, but it lacked the unloving hand of reality. Everything took five times longer to implement than anticipated, everything was sluggish and it didn’t scale very well at all. So you ended up with a pea-size slow and aenemic excuse of a brain that could not really be used for anything at all on its own, never mind “connecting to other minds”. The problems it did solve could have been solved by any conventional technology for a tenth of the price and with better results.</p>
<p><em>Everyone reported it as a huge success.</em></p>
<p>After that, they spent enormous amounts of money keeping the thing up and running, and as soon as they possible could started an “upgrade process” which in reality was a big “lets just get rid of this thing and give us anything <em>anything</em> as long as it actually works”. </p>
<p>I was a part of that upgrade process, and I’ve never had easier clients. We could in reality introduce whatever we wanted as long as it didn’t have a fancy name and as long as it did what it promised. </p>
<p>Now, this is just an end-of-the scale example - There are many more subtle ones. But these companies and agencies <em>knows</em> now not to trust easy truths, and that’s a good lesson indead. </p>
<p>It is just a shame that those lessons keep getting swept under the rug, making everyone learn the hard way.</p>
